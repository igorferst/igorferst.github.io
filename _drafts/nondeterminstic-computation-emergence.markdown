When I was taking my first course on computational complexity, I was
taught that the complexity class $$NP$$ is the set of decision problems that can be
efficiently solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM). I've always felt
this definition to be a little dissatisfying. That's because when students of complexity are
invited to develop intuition about $$NP$$, this class is presented as a
[metaphor for human creativity](http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/PUBLICATIONS/MYPAPERS/AW09/AW09.pdf),
capturing everything from proving theorems to composing symphonies.
Yet for every problem in $$NP$$, the canonical NTM that solves it always behaves
in the same simplistic way - it nondeterministically produces a solution,
confirms that this solution is correct, and that's that.

That's perfectly fine for the formalism of complexity theory, but if you believe
that $$NP$$ represents creative activity in our physical world, it's a bit lacking.
After all, in the real world, solutions to hard creative problems are not produced
by oracles and handed down for us mere mortals to verify - we mere mortals
actually do the solving!

Of course, we have no idea _how_ this happens, and the whole point of nondeterminism
is to sidestep this ignorance with an abstraction that says "it just does". Given how
successful complexity theory has been at illuminating profound truths about
